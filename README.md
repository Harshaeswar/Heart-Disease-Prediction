# Heart Disease Classification ðŸ«€  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting heart disease. Using clinical and health-related attributes, the system classifies whether a patient is at risk of heart disease. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and pipeline creation for deployment readiness.

## âœ¨ Key Features  
- End-to-end ML workflow from raw data to prediction.  
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).  
- Implementation of multiple models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, SVM.  
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and cross-validation.  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.  
- Visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn for better interpretability.  
- Pipeline integration for efficient processing of unseen data.
